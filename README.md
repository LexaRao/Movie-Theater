# Movie-Theater
The purpose of this Github is to document the ways that the Movie Theater ticketing system functions.  It will document both the back and front end of the ticketing system and analyze the ways the user interacts with these components.   We will be done using the Waterfall Method for the Development of the program.   


 

## Requirements:    

This section will document the requirements of the Ticketing System.  It will include the information from our software contractor.  We will define the document using IEEE-830-1998.  The PDF contains the version of this document being submitted in Canvas.   


## Software Design:  

The software design section will document the software design from the requirements.  These specifications describe the software organization and development plan.   This document is meant for the developers.  The PDF contains the version of this document being submitted by everyone using GitHub through Canvas.                      


## Test Plan:    

Responsible for outlining how the Theater Ticketing System is being tested.  Creates a plan to fully test the code to make sure it conforms to the requirements and makes sure that the code's defects are not too severe and the number of them is in an acceptable range.  


## Architecture Design w/Data Mgmt   

Looks into the ways that the architecture handles data and the ways that data is managed.  Looks into the ways that data is protected from malicious users.  Gives more details on low-level data management, and, what happens when something goes wrong.  Expands on the way the project can be expanded in the future.
